### **Developers**
--------------------

There are npm scripts for building the app, website client, and server both in dev and prod modes accessed using the following calls:

```
npm run app-dev
npm run app-prod

npm run client-dev
npm run client-prod

npm run server-dev
npm run server-prod
```

Additionally, the theoretically-totally-existent tests can be run using the command

```
npm run test
```

Remember to actually install your dependencies before complaining to Duncan about being a dunce.
```
npm install
```
